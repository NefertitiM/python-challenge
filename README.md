#Python Challenge
In this challenge I looped through two large sets of data, organized them into lists and performed calculations to summarize the data.

#Budget_Data
I retrieved this data from an excel file, and read it, separating the tuples by commas.
I defined variables and looped through the data to calculate the Profit, Average Change, Greatest Increase and Decrease.
Lastly, I printed the resuts to the terminal as well as a text file.

#Election Data
I retrieved this data from an excel file, and read it, separating the tuples by commas.
I defined variables and looped through the data to calculate the Total Votes, Votes per Candidate (absolute values and percentages), and identified the winner.
Lastly, I printed the resuts to the terminal as well as a text file.
